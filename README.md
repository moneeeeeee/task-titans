# 🏆 Task Titans – Chore Competition & Analytics App

A full-stack project to gamify and track chores using leaderboards, analytics, and stopwatch-based logging. Designed for both **solo users** and **groups** (friends/family/roommates), the app allows tracking, competing, and improving over time.

---

## **Features**

### Stopwatch Logging
- Web-based stopwatch (hh:mm:ss:ms)
- Logs chore duration to all groups a user is part of
- Supports dropdown + custom input for task name
- Logs are recorded in the backend in real time

### User Authentication
- Secure signup/login using hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- JWT-based authentication
- Each user auto-joins a private group at signup

### Group System
- Users can create, join, and manage chore groups
- Groups have shared task lists and leaderboards

### Personal Analytics
- Daily summary tables of all chores done
- Personal chore leaderboard with rankings
- Insights: average vs. latest performance

### Leaderboards
#### For Each Task:
- **Group**:
  - Best times (ever) per user
  - Daily/weekly/monthly ranks with dates
  - Average duration across a time range
- **Private**:
  - All past logs ranked by speed
  - Feedback: “You beat X% of your past logs”

### Visual Charts (Frontend Coming Soon)
- Chore performance graphs (line/bar)
- Date range filters, average lines
- Color-coded per task or user
